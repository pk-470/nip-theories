# NIP Theories and O-minimality,

This is an expository essay I wrote on model theory (a sub-branch of mathematical logic) as a part of Part III (i.e. the 4th year integrated masters) of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. The purpose of this essay is to introduce some fundamental results on NIP theories and o-minimality, both of which are active areas of research in model theory, to present a proof that the complete theory of an o-minimal structure is NIP, and to discuss Pillayâ€™s conjecture concerning definable groups in o-minimal structures.
